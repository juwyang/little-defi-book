### Merkle Tree
A data structure used in blockchain to summarize all transactions in a block and generate a single hash value, known as the Merkle root. How it works: The leaf nodes of a Merkle tree are the hashes of individual transaction data. Non-leaf nodes are the hashes of the concatenated hashes of their child nodes. This process is performed recursively until a single Merkle root is generated.

### SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256)
A cryptographic hash function that converts input data of any length into a unique hash value of a fixed length (256 bits, or 32 bytes). In blockchain, SHA256 is widely used to generate transaction hashes, block hashes (usually by performing two SHA256 operations on the block header, i.e., SHA256d), and for mining calculations in Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms.

### Lightning Network
A Layer 2 scaling solution for blockchains like Bitcoin, aimed at increasing transaction speed and reducing transaction fees. The Lightning Network achieves this by creating off-chain payment channels between users. Participants first lock a certain amount of funds on the mainchain to open a channel. Afterward, they can conduct multiple transactions within the channel, which only update the ledger between the participants and are not immediately broadcast to the mainchain. Only when the channel is finally closed is the net settlement result submitted to the mainchain.

### Multi-Path Routing
A routing mechanism in the Lightning Network where a sender splits a payment into several parts, each sent to the receiver via different paths within the Lightning Network. After receiving all parts, the receiver combines them to get the full payment amount.

### Rollup
A Layer 2 scaling solution where a large number of transactions are executed and aggregated off-chain. Then, either the compressed transaction data (for Optimistic Rollups) or a validity proof (for ZK Rollups) is submitted to the mainchain for recording and final confirmation. There are two types: Optimistic Rollup and ZK Rollup (Zero-Knowledge Rollup).
- **Optimistic Rollup**: Optimistically assumes all off-chain transactions are valid and submits them in batches to the mainchain. If someone believes a transaction batch is fraudulent, they can submit a fraud proof during a "challenge period." If the proof is valid, the batch is rolled back, and the malicious party is penalized.
- **ZK Rollup (Zero-Knowledge Rollup)**: Uses zero-knowledge proofs (like ZK-SNARKs or ZK-STARKs) to verify the validity of off-chain transactions. When a batch of transactions is submitted to the mainchain, it is accompanied by a validity proof demonstrating that all transactions are legitimate without revealing the specific details of the transactions.

### Cross-chain Bridge (Bridge)
Blockchain bridges are protocols or mechanisms that connect different blockchain networks, allowing assets, data, and information to be securely transferred and interact between them. Users can transfer tokens from one chain to be used on another (often in the form of wrapped tokens), enabling participation in DeFi activities on different chains, such as bridging Bitcoin to the Ethereum network to participate in liquidity mining. Bridges operate in various ways but typically involve locking or burning assets on one chain and then minting or unlocking an equivalent amount of corresponding assets on another chain.

### Scaling (Blockchain Scaling)
- **State Channels**: An off-chain technology not limited to payments, capable of handling any type of blockchain state update (e.g., state changes in games, interactions in decentralized applications). Participants can securely make any number of state updates within the channel without immediately submitting each update to the mainchain. How it works:
    (i) **Opening the Channel**: Participants jointly sign a multi-signature smart contract, locking a portion of the blockchain state (like funds or data) into this contract as the channel's initial state.
    (ii) **Off-chain Interaction**: Participants update the state within the channel by signing transactions. These transactions are not immediately submitted to the mainchain but are privately exchanged and validated by the participants. Each new state update requires signatures from all participants.
    (iii) **Closing the Channel**: When participants complete all interactions or wish to settle, they can submit the final, mutually agreed-upon state back to the smart contract on the mainchain. After the smart contract verifies the validity of the final state, it closes the channel and updates the mainchain state accordingly (e.g., distributing funds).
- **Payment Channels**: State channels specifically designed for handling payments. They allow two or more participants to conduct multiple, fast, low-cost off-chain payment transactions, only requiring interaction with the mainchain when opening and closing the channel.

### Smart Contract Deployment and Execution
- Deploying a smart contract is a special type of transaction. After deployment, the smart contract will have a unique address on the blockchain. Others can interact with the smart contract through this address.
- **Deployment Steps**:
  (i) **Write Contract Code**: Write the logic of the smart contract using a specific programming language (e.g., Solidity for Ethereum).
  (ii) **Compile Contract**: Compile the source code into bytecode understandable by a blockchain virtual machine (e.g., EVM). The compilation process usually also generates the contract's Application Binary Interface (ABI), which defines how to call the contract's functions.
  (iii) **Deployment Transaction**: Deploying a smart contract is itself a transaction. A developer initiates a special transaction from an externally owned account (an account with a private key and sufficient funds to pay Gas fees).
      - **Transaction Content**: This transaction typically contains the compiled bytecode and any parameters required by the constructor.
      - **Pay Gas**: Deploying a contract consumes computational resources, so corresponding Gas fees must be paid.
  (iv) **Network Confirmation & Contract Address Generation**:
      - **Broadcast & Packaging**: The deployment transaction is broadcast to the network and packaged into a new block by miners (or validators).
      - **Contract Address**: Once the block containing the deployment transaction is added to the blockchain, the smart contract is successfully deployed and receives a unique contract address. This address is used for subsequent interactions with the contract.
- **Interaction and Triggering**:
  - **Call Contract Functions**: After deployment, anyone can call its public functions by sending a transaction to the contract address (provided they know the contract address and ABI).
  - **Trigger Execution**: When a user sends a transaction calling a contract function, nodes in the network will execute the function's code and update the blockchain's state according to the contract logic.

### Payment Channel Creation, Closing, and Settlement
- In the Bitcoin network, the creation, closing, and settlement of payment channels are implemented using Multisig Addresses and Timelocks through the Bitcoin Script language. On smart contract platforms like Ethereum, these processes are managed by smart contracts.
- **Creating a payment channel** is effectively a special transaction: Participants create a Multisig Address, where spending funds from this address requires signatures from all parties in the channel. On platforms supporting smart contracts, like Ethereum, a specific smart contract is deployed to manage the channel. One or all involved participants send a certain amount of crypto assets to this multisig address or smart contract. This transaction is known as a "funding transaction" or "anchor transaction," which is broadcast to the network and recorded on the blockchain, marking the official opening of the channel and the locking of initial funds. If Alice wants to frequently pay Bob, Alice can unilaterally fund a unidirectional channel; alternatively, Alice and Bob can jointly fund a bidirectional channel, allowing funds to flow in both directions between them.
- **Transactions**: After the channel is opened, the parties can conduct any number of off-chain transactions between themselves. Each transaction generates a new "Commitment Transaction." This commitment transaction is itself a valid on-chain transaction that reallocates the locked funds within the channel, reflecting the latest balances of all parties. However, these commitment transactions are not immediately broadcast to the blockchain while the channel remains open; the parties simply exchange signatures and save the latest commitment transaction. This allows transactions to occur instantly with almost no delay.
- **Closing the Channel**: When parties decide to close the channel, they select the latest commitment transaction and broadcast it to the blockchain. This transaction updates the on-chain state and releases the funds locked in the multisig address or smart contract.
    - **Mutual Close**: Closing a channel typically requires signatures from all parties.
    - **Unilateral Close**: If one party disagrees with closing or becomes unresponsive, the other party can request a unilateral close. In this case, the party initiating the unilateral close will broadcast the latest mutually signed commitment transaction they hold to the blockchain. To prevent a party from fraudulently broadcasting an outdated commitment transaction favorable to themselves, there is usually a "dispute period" or "challenge period." During this time, if the other party possesses a more recent commitment transaction (its recency often proven through a mechanism like a penalty system), they can submit it to correct the final fund distribution.
- **Settlement**: Once the closing transaction is confirmed, the funds within the channel are distributed according to the latest commitment transaction. On-chain transaction fees for opening and closing the channel are earned by miners. If payments are routed through intermediary nodes in a payment channel network, these intermediaries may charge small routing fees.
- **Technical Details**:
  - **Commitment Transactions**: Parties continuously sign new commitment transactions to update the channel state. Old commitment transactions are invalidated through some mechanism (e.g., by exchanging secret values to void old commitments, or through decreasing timelocks that prioritize newer transactions).
  - **Hashed Time-Lock Contract (HTLC)**: This is a key technology for implementing more complex payment channel networks (like the Lightning Network). HTLCs allow for multi-hop payments without trusting intermediaries and ensure the atomicity of payments (either all succeed or all fail). It combines hashlocks (funds can only be unlocked by knowing a secret value) and timelocks (funds can be refunded after a certain time).

### Bitcoin Transaction Structure: UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)
A transaction is essentially a record creating a flow of funds, including inputs and outputs. The input part is the source of funds (UTXOs generated by previous transactions), and the output part is the destination of funds (UTXOs paid to the recipient and UTXOs for change returned to oneself). A single transaction can create multiple UTXOs (e.g., UTXO1, UTXO2, UTXO3...), for instance, (UTXO1 paid to the recipient and UTXO2 as change to oneself). The structure of a UTXO is (value, scriptPubKey). When a subsequent transaction needs to spend a previous UTXO, it references that UTXO's transaction ID and index, and provides an unlocking signature (scriptSig) to match the previous scriptPubKey. The scriptPubKey specifies the conditions under which this UTXO can be spent (e.g., transfer to a specific address), while the scriptSig is the proof that satisfies these conditions. A user's Bitcoin "balance" is the sum of all unspent UTXOs that their private key(s) can control. Bitcoin transactions do not have the concept of a sender's account; instead, control is achieved by holding private keys (a private key can correspond to multiple addresses), which can unlock a series of UTXOs.
